 * Registers all authentication-related APIs for the application.

 * routes in one place.
 *
 * @param {App} app - The main application instance to which the APIs will be registered.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The following APIs are registered:
 * - GoCardless Link API
 * - GoCardless Agreement API
 * - GoCardless Exchange API
 * - Plaid Link Accounts API
 * - Plaid Exchange Token API
 *
 * Each of these APIs is registered using its respective registration function,
 * which is imported from separate modules to keep the codebase modular and maintainable.

 * By centralizing the registration of these APIs, this module simplifies the process
