## Overview

**Logdrain** is a high-performance, globally distributed service engineered for real-time log collection, processing, and storage from diverse applications. Built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and deployed on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), Logdrain offers a robust solution for centralized log management at the edge.

Leveraging integration with [Axiom](https://axiom.co/), Logdrain provides advanced querying, visualization, and analytics capabilities. The service employs [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for schema validation, ensuring data integrity and reducing errors. With comprehensive error handling and security measures, Logdrain is an indispensable tool for developers and DevOps teams seeking insights into application behavior and performance.

## Quick Start

To quickly get started with Logdrain:

1. **Clone the Repository and Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SolomonAIEngineering/financial-platform-as-a-service/logdrain.git
   cd logdrain
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

   ```bash
   cp .dev.vars-example .dev.vars
   ```

   Edit `.dev.vars` and add your Axiom API token and other necessary configurations.

3. **Start the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The service will be accessible at `http://localhost:8787`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 14.x or later
- **npm**: Version 6.x or later
- **Wrangler CLI**: Install globally via `npm install -g wrangler`
- **Axiom Account and API Token**
- **Git**: For version control

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SolomonAIEngineering/financial-platform-as-a-service/logdrain.git
   cd logdrain
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

   ```bash
   cp .dev.vars-example .dev.vars
   ```

   Edit `.dev.vars` to include your Axiom API token and other configuration parameters.

### Configuration

Logdrain uses environment variables for configuration. Key variables include:

- **AXIOM_TOKEN**: Your Axiom API token.
- **AXIOM_ORG_ID**: Your Axiom organization ID.
- **AXIOM_DATASET**: (Optional) Axiom dataset name, defaults to `logdrain-logs`.
- **AUTHORIZATION**: Authorization token for secure log ingestion.
- **ENVIRONMENT**: Set to `development`, `staging`, or `production`.

**Example `.dev.vars` File:**

```ini
AXIOM_TOKEN=your-axiom-token
AXIOM_ORG_ID=your-axiom-org-id
AXIOM_DATASET=logdrain-logs
AUTHORIZATION=your-authorization-token
ENVIRONMENT=development
```

Ensure all variables are securely managed and not committed to version control.

## Usage

### Running Locally

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will use `wrangler dev` to run the Cloudflare Worker locally. The service will be accessible at `http://localhost:8787`.

### Deployment

Before deploying, ensure that your `wrangler.toml` is correctly configured with your Cloudflare account details.

**Deploy to Production:**

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This executes `wrangler publish` to deploy the service to your production environment.

**Deploy to Staging:**

Set up a staging environment in `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[env.staging]
name = "logdrain-staging"
account_id = "your-cloudflare-account-id"
workers_dev = true
```

Deploy to staging with:

```bash
npm run deploy:staging
```

## API Reference

### Authentication

Logdrain uses token-based authentication. Include the `Authorization` header in your HTTP requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN
```

### Endpoints

#### POST `/ingest`

Ingest logs into Logdrain.

- **URL:** `/ingest`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Headers:**
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN`

##### Request Body Schema

The request body should be a JSON object or array of log entries.

**Example:**

```json
[
  {
    "timestamp": "2023-10-25T14:30:00Z",
    "level": "info",
    "message": "User logged in",
    "service": "auth-service",
    "context": {
      "userId": "user_12345",
      "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1"
    }
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "2023-10-25T14:31:00Z",
    "level": "error",
    "message": "Failed to connect to database",
    "service": "database-service",
    "context": {
      "error": "ConnectionTimeout",
      "retry": true
    }
  }
]
```

- **timestamp** (string): ISO 8601 formatted timestamp.
- **level** (string): Log level (`info`, `warn`, `error`, etc.).
- **message** (string): Log message.
- **service** (string): Name of the service or application.
- **context** (object, optional): Additional contextual information.

##### Response

A successful ingestion returns a `204 No Content` status code with no body.

##### Error Responses

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid request payload.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Missing or invalid authorization token.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server encountered an unexpected condition.

### Data Models

#### LogEntry

TypeScript interface representing a log entry.

```typescript
interface LogEntry {
  timestamp: string;
  level: string;
  message: string;
  service: string;
  context?: { [key: string]: any };
}
```

### Request Validation

All incoming requests are validated using Zod schemas to ensure data integrity.

**Example Zod Schema for LogEntry:**

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

const logEntrySchema = z.object({
  timestamp: z.string().refine((val) => !isNaN(Date.parse(val)), {
    message: "Invalid timestamp format",
  }),
  level: z.enum(["trace", "debug", "info", "warn", "error", "fatal"]),
  message: z.string().min(1),
  service: z.string().min(1),
  context: z.record(z.any()).optional(),
});
```

Validation errors will result in a `400 Bad Request` response with details about the validation failure.

### Response Format

- **Successful Ingestion**: `204 No Content`
- **Error Responses**: JSON object with error details.

**Error Response Example:**

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_REQUEST",
    "message": "Invalid log entry format.",
    "details": [
      {
        "path": ["0", "timestamp"],
        "message": "Invalid timestamp format."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Error Handling

Errors are handled gracefully and returned in a standardized format.

- **Error Codes**:
  - `INVALID_REQUEST` (400)
  - `UNAUTHORIZED` (401)
  - `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` (500)

## Integration with Axiom

All logs are streamed to Axiom for storage and analysis.

### Configuration

Set the following environment variables:

- **AXIOM_TOKEN**: Your Axiom API token.
- **AXIOM_ORG_ID**: Your Axiom organization ID.
- **AXIOM_DATASET**: (Optional) The dataset to which logs will be sent. Defaults to `logdrain-logs`.

### Data Ingestion

Logs are sent to Axiom using their HTTP ingest API. Each log entry is structured with relevant metadata.

**Example Log Entry to Axiom:**

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-10-25T14:30:00Z",
  "level": "info",
  "message": "User logged in",
  "service": "auth-service",
  "context": {
    "userId": "user_12345",
    "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1"
  },
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### Querying Data

Use Axiom's query language to perform analyses, such as:

- Filtering logs by service or level.
- Aggregating logs over time.
- Searching for specific error messages.

### Visualization

Create dashboards in Axiom to visualize:

- Log levels over time.
- Service performance metrics.
- Error rates and alerts.
