## Directory Structure

This structure showcases a well-organized monorepo setup with clear separation of concerns:

1. The `apps` directory contains different applications within the project.
2. The `internal` directory houses internal modules and utilities.
3. The `packages` directory includes shared packages used across the project.
4. The `services` directory contains various microservices.
5. The `tooling` directory manages development and build tools configurations.
6. Configuration files at the root level manage the overall project setup.

This structure allows for efficient code sharing, easier maintenance, and scalability across different parts of the project.

    ```

    2. MacOS

    ```bash
      /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
      brew install git
      brew install oven-sh/bun/bun
      brew install nvm
    ```

2. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
    1. You can use Vercel Postgres or a local PostgreSQL server(add POSTGRES_URL env in .env.local)
        ```bash
           bun install -g supabase
        ```

### Installation

2. Manually clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SolomonAIEngineering/financial-platform-as-a-service.git

cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
cp apps/app/.env.example apps/app/.env
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
```

5. Start the development server from either bun or turbo:

```ts
bun dev // starts everything in development mode (web, app, api, email)
bun dev:web // starts the web app in development mode
bun dev:app // starts the app in development mode
bun dev:api // starts the api in development mode
