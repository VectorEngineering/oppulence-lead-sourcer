              Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming how small
              businesses find and nurture sales leads. Traditional lead sourcing
              ‚Äì manual prospecting, purchasing static contact lists, or relying
              on gut feeling ‚Äì is being replaced by AI-driven platforms that
              automate discovery, enrichment, and prioritization of prospects.
            </p>
            <p className="text-left text-gray-500">
              Small firms, often limited in time and sales personnel, stand to
              gain a disproportionate advantage from these tools. Companies
              using AI for lead generation have seen over 50% increases in
              sales-ready leads and a 60% reduction in costs. In fact, 74% of
              small business owners believe employees using AI tools give them a
              competitive edge over peers. ‚è≥

              The lead generation landscape is undergoing a seismic shift away
              from manual list building and cold calls toward data-driven,
              automated strategies. Instead of relying on gut instinct or
              generic campaigns, companies are leveraging AI to analyze customer
              data and online behavior to pinpoint the most promising prospects.

              AI-powered predictive analytics can identify prospects before they
              even raise their hand, by spotting intent signals or patterns that
              correlate with buying interest. Small businesses benefit by
              focusing their limited sales resources on leads most likely to
              convert, rather than exhausting effort on unqualified contacts.
              Our platform delivers rich intelligence on each lead and helps
              users craft relevant messages.

              About 87% of companies with 10‚Äì100 employees use a CRM system as
              the heart of their sales operations. Any lead sourcing platform
              must play nicely with CRMs. Businesses want new leads flowing
              directly into their CRM, and updates like lead scores or contact
              enrichments syncing automatically.
