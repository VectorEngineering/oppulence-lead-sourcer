              The first master plan that I wrote is now in the final stages of
              completion. It wasn't all that complicated and basically consisted
              of:
            </p>

            <ol className="list-decimal space-y-2 pl-6">
              <li>Build premium AI lead sourcing platform</li>
              <li>
                Use that money to build an affordable lead engagement system
              </li>
              <li>
                Use that money to build a fully autonomous sales assistant
              </li>
              <li>
                While doing the above, also provide integration with the entire
                small business tech stack
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              The reason we had to start with step 1 was that it was all I could
              afford to do while being fully bootstrapped. I thought our chances
              of success were so low that I didn't want to risk significant
              outside capital in the beginning. The list of successful
              AI-powered sales platforms that truly serve small businesses is
              short. As of 2025, the number of AI lead generation companies that
              haven't been acquired by tech giants or pivoted to enterprise-only
              is a grand total of a few. Starting a B2B SaaS company is
              challenging and an AI-powered sales platform for small businesses
              is complexity squared.
            </p>

            <p>
              Also, a premium lead sourcing platform means a much smaller, more
              focused product, albeit with most features hand-tuned. Without
              economies of scale, anything we built would be expensive, whether
              it was a basic contact finder or an advanced lead generation
              system. While at least some businesses would be prepared to pay a
              high price for premium leads, no one was going to pay enterprise
              prices for a basic AI assistant, no matter how sophisticated it
              seemed.
            </p>

            <p>
              Part of the reason I wrote the first master plan was to defend
              against the inevitable skepticism our company would face accusing
              us of just creating another lead generation tool, implying that we
              felt there was a shortage of contact databases or some other
              bizarre rationale. Unfortunately, the blog didn't stop countless
              dismissive comments on exactly these grounds, so it pretty much
              completely failed that objective.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, the main reason was to explain how our actions fit into a
              larger picture, so that they would seem less random. The point of
              all this was, and remains, accelerating the democratization of
              AI-powered sales technology, so that small businesses can compete
              effectively against larger companies with massive sales teams.
              That's what "democratization" means. It's not some marketing
              buzzword — it matters for millions of small businesses worldwide.
            </p>

            <p>
              By definition, we must at some point achieve a sales ecosystem
              where AI handles the tedious parts of prospecting and engagement,
              or small businesses will continue to waste countless hours on
              manual processes while their enterprise competitors deploy
              sophisticated automation. Given that we must embrace AI-driven
              sales anyway and that virtually all experts agree that
              dramatically increasing human time spent on repetitive sales tasks
              is inefficient, the faster we achieve this transformation, the
              better.
            </p>

            <p>Here is what we plan to do to make that day come sooner:</p>

                  className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full"

                ></span>
              </span>
            </h2>

            <p>
              Create a smoothly integrated and intuitive AI-powered platform
              that just works, empowering small businesses as their own sales
              department, and then scale that throughout the world. One
              interface, one data ecosystem, one subscription, one mobile app.
            </p>

            <p>
              We can't do this well if our lead sourcing, engagement, and
              conversion tools are separate products, which is why we need to
              combine and break down the barriers inherent to being separate
              systems. That they were initially developed as distinct modules,
              despite pursuing the same overarching goal of sales automation,
              was largely for practical development reasons. Now that our lead
              sourcing engine is proven and our engagement system is ready for
              market, the time has come to bring them together.

            <p>
              Today, our platform addresses two relatively small segments of the
              sales process: lead sourcing and basic scoring. With our
              next-generation system, complete CRM integration, and advanced
              analytics suite, we plan to address the entire customer
              acquisition journey. A simpler system than our current offering is
              unlikely to be necessary, because of the third part of the plan
              described below.
            </p>

            <p>
              What really matters to accelerate AI adoption among small
              businesses is being able to scale our data processing capabilities
              as quickly as possible. That is why our engineering team has
              transitioned to focus heavily on designing the AI that improves
              the AI — turning our machine learning models themselves into
              products. A first-principles analysis of sales automation suggests
              that somewhere between a 5 to 10 fold improvement in lead quality
              and conversion rate is achievable by version 3 on a roughly
              18-month iteration cycle. The first integrated platform should be
              thought of as version 0.5, with version 1.0 probably in mid-2026.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to B2B sales tools, there are two other types of
              AI-powered platforms needed: customer retention systems and
              enterprise partnership networks. Both are in the early stages of
              development and should be ready for unveiling next year. We
              believe our Customer Success AI will deliver a substantial
              reduction in churn while increasing lifetime value and making
              account management truly scalable for small teams.
            </p>

            <p>
              With the advent of autonomous sales engagement, it will probably
              make sense to shrink the size of sales teams and transition the
              role of SDR to that of strategy manager. Sales productivity would
              improve due to increased prospect engagement by eliminating
              repetitive outreach tasks and matching communication tone and
              timing to prospect behavior, thus avoiding the inefficiencies of
              traditional cold calling approaches. It would also nurture leads
              all the way to their buying decision. Fixed engagement templates
              at existing marketing touchpoints would serve those prospects who
              respond to different triggers.

            <p>
              As the technology matures, all aspects of our platform will have
              the AI capability necessary to be fully autonomous with
              fail-operational capability, meaning that any given module in the
              system could underperform and your sales process will still
              function effectively. It is important to emphasize that refinement
              and validation of the algorithms will take much longer than
              putting in place the data processing, enrichment, and computing
              infrastructure.
            </p>

            <p>
              Even once the AI is highly refined and far better than the average
              sales rep at routine tasks, there will still be a significant
              adoption gap, varying widely by industry, before true autonomous
              selling is embraced by most businesses. We expect that widespread
              market acceptance will require something on the order of 500
              million successful interactions. Current platform learning is
              happening at just over 2 million interactions per day.
            </p>

            <p>
              I should add a note here to explain why we are deploying partial
              autonomy now, rather than waiting until some point in the future.
              The most important reason is that, when used correctly, it is
              already significantly more efficient than a person handling
              prospecting by themselves, and it would therefore be
              counterproductive to delay release simply for fear of being seen
              as "just another AI tool" or some mercantile calculation of market
              positioning.
            </p>

            <p>
              According to recent industry reports, sales teams spend only 28%
              of their time actually selling, with the rest consumed by
              administrative tasks and research. Our partial automation already
              reduces this wasted time by 65%, and the system gets better every
              day. It would no more make sense to disable our AI Assistant
              features, as some have suggested, than it would to disable CRM
              automation tools, after which some of our system components are
              modeled.
            </p>

            <p>
              When true autonomous engagement is embraced by businesses, it will
              mean that you can deploy your sales AI across virtually unlimited
              prospects. Once it identifies qualified opportunities, you will be
              able to focus exclusively on high-value strategic conversations
              while the AI handles everything else enroute to closing the deal.
            </p>

            <p>
              You will also be able to add your trained AI models to our shared
              knowledge network just by enabling a feature in our platform
              settings and have it generate improved performance for you while
              you're focused on other aspects of your business, significantly
              increasing conversion rates and at times potentially exceeding the
              results of your previous manual processes. This dramatically
              lowers the true cost of customer acquisition to the point where
              almost any small business could utilize enterprise-grade sales
              technology. Since most sales professionals spend only 20% to 30%
              of their day on actual selling activities, the fundamental
              economic utility of a true autonomous sales platform is likely to
              be several times that of traditional approaches.
