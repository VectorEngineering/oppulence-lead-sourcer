        <ol class="list-decimal space-y-4 pl-4 text-sm sm:pl-6 sm:text-base">
          <li>
            <strong>Coding LeetCode Problems in PearAI</strong>: You can now solve LeetCode problems directly in PearAI. Create a new file for your solution and start coding as you would in a real interview setting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>PearAI LeetCode Command</strong>:
            Type into the PearAI chatbox:
            <br /><br />
            <code class="rounded bg-gray-200 px-1 dark:bg-gray-700">/leetcode [LINK_TO_LEETCODE_PROBLEM] @[YOUR_SOLUTION_FILE]</code>
            <br /><br />
            This command kicks off your practice / learning process!
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Get Helpful Guidance</strong>: As you work on the problem, PearAI provides suggestions and hints, similar to what you might experience in an actual interview setting. This helps you improve your problem-solving skills and learn best practices.

        <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-4 text-sm sm:pl-6 sm:text-base">
          <li><strong>Problem Analysis</strong>: Get insights into potential approaches that you may not have considered.</li>
          <li><strong>Hint System</strong>: Receive gradual hints if you're stuck, encouraging independent problem-solving.</li>
          <li><strong>Code Review</strong>: Get feedback on your solution's efficiency and style.</li>
          <li><strong>Interview-Focused Approach</strong>: By emphasizing the thought process, it prepares you to articulate your strategies during actual interviews.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
