  <p class="text-base font-semibold leading-relaxed sm:text-lg md:text-xl">
    At PearAI, we're constantly striving to improve our open-source AI code editor. Our latest advancement involves integrating Anthropic's Claude 3.5 model to enhance code syntax and logic understanding when providing AI context to a user's codebase. This integration presented unique challenges and opportunities that we're excited to share with you.

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary-600 dark:text-primary-400 sm:text-2xl">Why Claude 3.5?</h2>
    <p class="text-sm sm:text-base">
      Claude 3.5 offers significant improvements in natural language understanding and code comprehension. By leveraging this model, we aimed to:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-4 text-sm sm:pl-6 sm:text-base">
      <li>Enhance the accuracy of code suggestions and completions</li>
      <li>Improve the AI's understanding of complex code structures and logic</li>
      <li>Provide more context-aware responses to user queries about their codebase</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary-600 dark:text-primary-400 sm:text-2xl">The Implementation Challenge</h2>
    <p class="text-sm sm:text-base">
      One of the main hurdles we faced was adapting our existing infrastructure to work with Claude 3.5. Unlike other LLMs we've used, such as OpenAI's models, Claude 3.5 required a different approach to prompt handling:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-4 text-sm sm:pl-6 sm:text-base">
      <li>Our existing setup handled server prompts from the client-side</li>
      <li>Claude 3.5 needed server-side prompt handling for optimal performance and security</li>
      <li>This discrepancy required us to rethink our architecture for Anthropic integration specifically</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary-600 dark:text-primary-400 sm:text-2xl">Our Solution</h2>
    <p class="text-sm sm:text-base">To address this challenge, we implemented a hybrid approach:</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal space-y-2 pl-4 text-sm sm:pl-6 sm:text-base">
      <li>We maintained our client-side handling for existing LLMs to ensure backwards compatibility</li>
      <li>For Claude 3.5, we developed a new server-side handler specifically for Anthropic API calls</li>
      <li>We created a routing mechanism to direct requests to the appropriate handler based on the selected AI model</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm sm:text-base">
      This solution allowed us to leverage Claude 3.5's capabilities while maintaining support for our other AI models.
