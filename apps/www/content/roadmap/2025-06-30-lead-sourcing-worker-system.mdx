description: "Implementation of a scalable worker system for lead processing with advanced queue management."
status: "planned"
product: "Lead Sourcing"
features:
  - "Redis-based queue system with priority levels"
  - "Adaptive scaling based on queue size and metrics"
  - "Retry mechanism with exponential backoff"
  - "Dead letter queue for failed jobs"
  - "Worker health monitoring and metrics"
  - "Graceful shutdown mechanisms"
