This release introduces comprehensive team workspace functionality, enabling seamless collaboration for small businesses with multiple team members working on lead generation and sales. Workspaces provide organized environments where teams can collaborate effectively while maintaining data separation between different projects or departments.

Our workspace implementation is specifically designed for small business needs, allowing you to organize lead generation efforts by product line, geographic region, or any other organizational structure that makes sense for your business. The granular permission system ensures team members have appropriate access levels while maintaining security.

## New Features

- **Create & Manage Workspaces**: Set up dedicated spaces for different teams, products, or campaigns with customizable settings and branding options
- **Team Member Invitations**: Add colleagues to your workspace with role-based permissions (Admin, Editor, Viewer) and easily manage access through the user interface
- **Workspace Switching**: Seamlessly switch between different workspaces you belong to from a convenient dropdown menu in the navigation bar
- **Activity Logs**: Track all changes and actions performed by team members within each workspace with detailed timestamps and user information
- **Resource Sharing**: Share configurations, templates, and settings across workspace members to maintain consistency in lead generation efforts
