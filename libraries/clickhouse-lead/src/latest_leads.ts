/**
 * Creates a function to retrieve the most recent lead information from the database.
 * 
 * @param ch - The ClickHouse querier instance
 * @returns An async function that accepts workspace and optional lead ID parameters
 * 
 * @remarks
 * This function queries the latest lead event with the following characteristics:
 * - Filters out test/demo leads based on company name
 * - Ensures data quality by checking for non-empty email and company
 * - Only returns active leads (current_status = 'ACTIVE')
 * - Orders results by timestamp in descending order
 * - Limits to 1 result (the most recent)
 * 
 * The returned lead information includes:
 * - Timestamp (as Unix milliseconds)
 * - Lead ID
 * - Company name
 * - Current stage and status
 * - Final score
 * - Deal size and probability
 * - Tags and industry
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const ch = new Client({ url: 'http://localhost:8123' });
 * const getLatest = getLatestLead(ch);
 * 
 * // Get latest lead for a workspace
 * const result = await getLatest({
 *   workspaceId: 'ws_123'
 * });
 * 
 * // Get latest lead for a specific lead ID
 * const result = await getLatest({
 *   workspaceId: 'ws_123',
 *   leadId: 'lead_456'
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * @returns A promise that resolves to an object containing the lead information,
 * or an error if the query fails. The result is validated against a Zod schema
 * that ensures type safety for all returned fields.
