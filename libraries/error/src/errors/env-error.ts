 * Error class for environment variable configuration issues.

 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // When an environment variable is missing
 * throw new EnvError({
 *   message: "Required environment variable not found",
 *   context: { name: "API_KEY" }
 * });
 * 
 * // When an environment variable has an invalid value
 * throw new EnvError({
 *   message: "Environment variable must be a number",
 *   context: { name: "MAX_RETRIES" }
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * @remarks
 * This error is non-retryable as environment configuration issues
 * typically require manual intervention to resolve.
